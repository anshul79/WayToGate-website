    <ol>
        <li>Aim for taking Gate exam varies from candidate to candidate. If students aim to get into IIt or equivalent 
                institutions, very high percentile is required.</li>
        <li> Normally 3 to 4 months of serious study should be sufficient for preparation. </li>
        <li> In the first run, study all the topics as per syllabus.</li>
        <li> In the revision stage, concentrate more on selected topics. </li>
        <li> Try to solve papers papers of previous years. This will give you an idea about the mismatch between the actual
            paper and your level of preparation.</li>
        <li> Fill up the gap by extra study.</li>
        <li> Try to take up practice tests.</li>
    </ol>

   <ol>
       <li> One day before the exam, revise the course.
       <li> During exam, try section A first. Q1 carry 1 mark each and Q2 carry 2 marks each.
       <li> Manage the time well during the exam.
       <li> In the hall, one should not get panicky upon recieving the question paper.<br>
           Time management is important but not at the cost of answering the paper accurately.
       <li>Even you find the paper tough, DO NOT panic. It will be hard for all.
       <li> Do not try to get hold of the entire syllabus prescribed for Gate. A selective preparation would be a very
           helpful concept and should be learned accurately.<br>
           Memorization of any problem without a clear idea of the concept will be a futile exercise.
       <li> I feel that it is better to have flexible time plan before going to exam and have a balance of mind.
           It helps in avoiding mistakes.
