          The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an All-India Examination conducted by the six Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian
          Institute of Science, Bangalore, on behalf of the national Coordinating Board-GATE, Department of education, Ministry of Human resource
          Development(MHRD), government of India. Admission of Postgraduate Courses, with MHRD Scholarship/Assistantship, in Engineering/Technology/
          Architecture/Pharmacy at Colleges/Institutes will be open only to those who qualify in GATE.</p>
      
<p>The <b>objective</b> of GATE is to identify meritorious and motivated candidates for admission to Postgraduate Programs in engineering at National 
    level. Every year one IIT or IIsc is selected as the Organizing institute.</p>

<font color="#777"><h2>Difficulty level of GATE</h2></font>
<p>GATE, for long, has been known to test the Engineering basics in a smart way. Complaints of "lengthy" problems have been
rare. But the task of mastering an entire course of Engineering (30 plus subjects) for a three hour test, itself gives the
test a certain level of toughness. Each year, only around 15% of all appearing candidates qualify.</p><br>

You can take any number of attempts, if bad results comes.<br><br>
