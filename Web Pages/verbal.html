            Verbal Ability refers to oral or spoken language abilities. You will usually find questions on all of the 
            following:
            <ul>
                <li>Spelling
                <li>Grammar
                <li>Sentence Completion

                <li>Instructions 
                <li> Reasoning

            </ul>
            <p> <font color="#777"> <b>Spelling Questions </b></font></p>
            Questions where you have to identify incorrectly spelt words are common in all levels of verbal ability tests.
            The test designer needs to choose words which are fairly common and in regular usage but which are often spelt 
            incorrectly.
            <p> <font color="#777"> <b>Example Questions </b></font></p>
            <ol>
                
            <li>

               A) separate &nbsp; B) ordnance &nbsp; C) obviously &nbsp; D) sucess &nbsp; E) none of these <br><br></li>

            <li>

            <p> <font color="#777"> <b>Missing Word Questions </b></font></p>
            These questions are designed to measure your vocabulary, specifically your understanding of precise word meanings.
            <p>
             You will usually be offered a choice of four or five words, any of which could complete the sentence. 
             These questions are relatively straightforward but because more than one of the options will complete the
             sentence satisfactorily you must read it carefully and choose the best word.</p>

   <p> <font color="#777"> <b>Related Word Questions </b></font></p>
To answer these word relationship questions you need to understanding of precise meaning of the words in the question 
and establish what exactly the relationship is between them. These questions test your reasoning ability as well as your 
vocabulary. 
<p> <font color="#777"> <b>Example Questions </b></font></p>
<ol start="5">
    <li>
        Which of these is the missing word? <br><br>

best option.<br><br>

<p> <font color="#777"> <b>Synonym and Antonym Questions  </b></font></p>

These are words which have either the same or opposite meanings. Once again, these word meaning questions 
test your vocabulary – you need to know the precise meaning of the words given in order to select the appropriate synonym
(same meaning) or antonym (opposite meaning).<br>

<p> <font color="#777"> <b>Example Questions </b></font></p>
        <ol start="8"><li>

    <p> <font color="#777"> <b>Word Pair Questions  </b></font></p>
    
    Firstly, you need to establish the relationship between the ‘X is to Y’ words before you can arrive at the answer.
    Some people find it helpful to mentally express the relationship before they look at the answer options. This can 
    short circuit the process of considering and rejecting each option because you know in advance exactly what you are 
    looking for.<br>
    
    <p> <font color="#777"> <b>Example Questions </b></font></p>

12. B – The word pairs are opposites<br>
13. E – Paper is made from timber, leather is made from hide<br><br>

<p> <font color="#777"> <b>Comprehension Questions  </b></font></p>
These questions consist of a short passage and some related questions. They will often be about a topic which is
unfamiliar to you, but this is an advantage rather than a disadvantage because you need to answer the questions based 
only on the information that you are given – not using any knowledge that you already have. Most people find that the 
best way to tackle these verbal comprehension questions is to scan the text fairly quickly to get the general idea and 
then to attempt each question in turn, referring back to the appropriate part of the text.

 <p> <font color="#777"> <b>Example Questions </b></font></p>
 <ol start="14">
     <li>
         
         Read the following short passage and say whether or not the statements are true.<br><br>


There are seven species of deer living wild in Britain. The Red Deer and the Roe Deer are native species. Fallow Deer
were introduced by the Romans and, since the seventeenth century, have been joined by three other non-native species: 
Sika, Muntjac and Chinese Water Deer which have escaped from parks. In addition, a herd of Reindeer was established in
Scotland in 1952. Most of the Red Deer in Britain are found in Scotland, but there are significant wild populations in
south-west and north-west England, East Anglia and the north Midlands. Red deer can interbreed with the introduced 
Japanese Sika deer and in some areas, hybrids are common. <br><br>
<ol type="a">
    <li>

        All of the Red Deer in Britain are found in Scotland. <br>

    A) true &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) false &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C) can't say<br></li>

  

    <li>Red Deer can interbreed with Fallow Deer. <br>

<li>The Fallow Deer is not native to Britain. <br>

  A) true &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) false &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C) can't say <br></li>

  

<li>There are no Reindeer in England.<br>


  A) true &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) false &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C) can't say <br></li>

*Note that you must answer these verbal comprehension questions using only the information supplied. Red Deer cannot
interbreed with Fallow Deer but, because this is not stated in the text, you must answer ‘can’t say’ even if you know 
that the statement is technically false.<br><br>

<p> <font color="#777"> <b>Reasoning Questions  </b></font></p>
These questions are not concerned with measuring your facility with English. They are designed to test your ability to
take a series of facts expressed in words and to understand and manipulate the information to solve a specific problem. 
Verbal reasoning questions are usually restricted to graduate and management level tests.

<p> <font color="#777"> <b>Example Questions </b></font></p>
 <ol start="15">
     <li>
 Working together, Tom, Dick and Harry need 9 hours to paint a 400 meter long fence. Working alone, Tom could complete
 the task in 18 hours. Dick can not work as fast and needs 36 hours to paint the fence by himself. If Tom and Dick take 
 the day off, how long will it take Harry to paint the fence by himself? <br>

 A)9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B) 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C) 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D)36 <br></li>
 </ol>

  

Answer<br>
15. D – In 9 hours Tom would have painted half of the fence and Dick would have painted one quarter of it. This leaves
one quarter to be painted by Harry who must therefore work at the same speed as Dick.<br><br>
